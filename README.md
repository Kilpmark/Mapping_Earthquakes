# Mapping_Earthquakes

The final product is Earthquake Challenge. Using Leaflet, the D3 library, and the MapBox API an interactive map is generated showing earthquakes from the past seven days. The data was obtained from the USGS. Three layers are can be selected: street, satellite, and dark. Tectonic plate boundaries are also shown. The earthquake locations and plate boundaries may be toggled as desired by the user. Each earthquake's marker includes information about the magnitude and general location.
